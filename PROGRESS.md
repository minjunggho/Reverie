# PROGRESS — Reverie

**Status:** MVP + experience overhaul + rules evolution (SRD 5.2.1) + P0 multiplayer
identity fix + **E5 campaign canon & world navigation**. **133 passing tests.**

## E5 — campaign canon & world navigation (2026-07-10)

Fixes the observed failure where the DM asked players to author the world
("เจ้าเห็นอะไรข้างนอก?"). Root cause + design: docs/world-canon.md.

- **Geography & travel graph.** `Location` gains `location_type`/`parent_id`/
  `provenance`/`weather`/`current_activity`; new `LocationConnection` is the
  authoritative directed edge (label/direction/travel_minutes/obvious/one_way/
  access_state). `WorldGraphService.resolve_exit` maps natural movement
  ("ออกไปข้างนอก", "ขึ้นชั้นสอง", a destination name) to a canonical edge — never
  by list order, never invented.
- **Canonical position.** `Character.location_id`; `PositionService` (where/move/
  co-located). Session start places every attendee at the opening location. Party
  splits are representable.
- **Campaign canon.** `Campaign.brief`/`central_question`/`session_prep`; new
  `CampaignCanonRecord` (category/fact/visibility/provenance/importance/scope) for
  world-bible facts + clues. Reuses (no duplicate truth): Secret=DM secrets,
  NPC+epistemic=characters, Threat+ScheduledWorldEvent=factions/fronts+pressure,
  Location=places, Event=history, KnowledgeRecord=provenance.
- **Importer v2** (`canon_import.py`): full-section Markdown/JSON parser (identity,
  brief, central question, world facts, locations+geo+exits, factions, NPCs,
  secrets+clues, threats, Session 1 prep) → structured proposal with counts +
  **warnings** (NPC without goal/location, secret with <2 clues, unknown refs).
  Owner reviews (`!rv campaign import`), confirms, commits atomically. Nothing is
  canon before confirmation; the old locations-only path still works.
- **TravelService** (the fix): natural movement → resolve exit → advance world clock
  (ticks threats/events) → move the party → transition the scene → **frame the
  destination FROM CANON**. The narrator never invents the destination.
- **WorldExpansionService**: an unauthored ordinary place is proposed from bounded
  settlement context, committed (provenance AI_EXPANDED) with a connection + optional
  proprietor NPC BEFORE narration, and **persists** — the same request returns the
  same location, never a regenerated duplicate.
- **SceneContextBuilder**: bounded, authorized canonical context (location obvious
  desc, exits, parent geography, present cast, local canon, active threats, allowed
  clues, recent events) — feeds narration so the DM already knows the world. DM
  secrets never enter a player-facing block.
- **Session 1 from prep**: imported `session_prep` sets the opening location, present
  NPCs, current activity, and allowed clues; the opening generator is constrained by
  it (presentation freedom, not freedom to discard the campaign).
- **Anti-hallucination** (`narration_guard.py`): `screen_narration` /
  `screen_decision_prompt` deterministically strip/rewrite world-authoring questions
  ("เจ้าเห็นอะไร?", "เมืองนี้ชื่ออะไร?") from committed narration — a structural
  guard, not a prompt plea. Fact-provenance policy documented.
- **World pressure continues**: travel advances the clock, which ticks Threats/
  ScheduledWorldEvents — the world doesn't freeze when players ignore the plot.

**Tests** (`tests/test_world_canon.py`, 9 + the Last Funeral of God fixture):
import review identifies all sections + warnings; atomic canon commit (geo/graph/
NPCs/secrets/clues/factions/threats/prep); Session 1 opens at the imported location
with prep; `! เดินออกไปข้างนอก` transitions to the canonical connected location and
never asks the player to author scenery; travel advances time + ticks threats;
AI-expanded location persists across a return; narration screen blocks bad DM
questions; secrets don't leak into player scene context.

**Limitations (documented):** party travels together by default (explicit "stay"
splits deferred though position tracking supports them); world expansion covers
ordinary places only (no plot generation); the deterministic Markdown parser is
EXPLICITLY_AUTHORED — an AI gap-filling analyzer (AI_PROPOSED) is future; a fresh
Alembic autorevision is needed for Postgres (tests use `create_all`; delete the
local dev SQLite once — new columns/tables were added).

## P0 multiplayer identity / party-context fix (2026-07-10)

**Confirmed root cause (traced against the code, all 9 points verified):**

1. `DiscordBridge.handle_inbound` correctly resolves the SENDER → CampaignMember →
   active Character (the actor). ✔ actor identity was never the bug.
2. `CommittedActionPipeline._process` loads scene + acting character + campaign and
   passes **only the acting Character** into the interpreter/adjudicator. ✔ confirmed.
3. `build_action_interpretation_context` emits `SCENE / CHARACTER / ACTION` where
   CHARACTER is only the actor — no directory of the other present PCs. ✔ confirmed.
4. `SceneBrief` carries mode/purpose/location/visible_entities but **never hydrates
   `scene.participants`** — the party refs exist on the scene but reach no prompt. ✔.
5. `visible_entities` are passed as **raw refs** (`character:abc`, `npc:xyz`) with no
   canonical name or type, so the model can't tie "Aria" to `character:<aria_id>`. ✔.
6. Session OPENING is party-aware (it hydrates all attendees' names/hooks); that
   context is thrown away for normal active play. ✔ confirmed the asymmetry.
7. `ActionInterpretation.target_references` is extracted but the pipeline **never
   resolves or uses it**. ✔ confirmed.
8. `_primary_npc_target(scene)` returns the **first `npc:` ref by list order** from
   `immediate_threat_ids + visible_entity_ids` — ignores `target_references`, never
   resolves a player-character target, and mis-targets (`! ผมขู่พ่อค้า` → Guard). ✔.
9. `build_narration_context` receives only a raw `target_ref` string — no typed
   actor/target/present-party identity. ✔ confirmed.

**Net:** the party's canonical identities live on `scene.participants`, but nothing
downstream of session-open hydrates them, resolves target mentions against them, or
distinguishes a present player-character from an NPC. So another player's character
mentioned by name reads as an unknown person.

**Architecture of the fix (see below in this doc + docs/multiplayer-identity.md):**
a SceneEntityDirectory hydrates the *present* entities (PC vs NPC, canonical name,
controller) — presence = `scene.participants`/`visible_entity_ids`, **not** party
membership; an EntityResolver maps `target_references` → canonical refs with
conservative precedence; the pipeline resolves ONCE at the engine boundary and
propagates typed actor+targets into adjudication/consequence/narration; PC-agency
is structurally enforced (the engine refuses to execute a command over another PC's
voluntary choice — not merely a narrator instruction); `_primary_npc_target` is
replaced by resolved-target selection.

**Architecture changes (files):** `app/entities/` (SceneEntityDirectory +
EntityContext + resolver); `Character.aliases`, `Scene.spotlight`,
`ActionInterpretation.commands_other_pc`; party-aware context builders +
interpreter/adjudicator/consequence/narrator jobs; pipeline resolves target
mentions once, gates ambiguity/presence/PC-agency, threads typed targets through
the dice ritual, records resolved targets on the committed event, and bumps
spotlight; `_primary_npc_target` (first-by-order) removed — NPC consequence target
is the resolved NPC or the scene's *immediate threat*; router preserves dialogue
speaker identity. Prompts updated (interpreter target_references + commands_other_pc;
narrator actor/target non-swap + PC-agency). See docs/multiplayer-identity.md.

**Migration:** additive columns only (`characters.aliases`, `scenes.spotlight`);
`create_all` covers tests; delete the local dev SQLite once; Postgres gets an
Alembic autorevision. Existing campaigns remain usable.

**Tests added (`tests/test_multiplayer_identity.py`, 14):** actor mapping per
sender · party name → existing PC (no NPC invention) · Thai alias · command-over-PC
refused · declaring another PC's action refused · physical action on unconscious PC
allowed · NPC target by name not list order · same-name ambiguity → one clarify ·
absent party member not reachable · Discord name ≠ character alias · actor/target
distinct in directory · party view == scene directory · dialogue speaker preserved ·
no PLAYER_ONLY leak into another player's action context.

**Remaining multiplayer limitations (documented, not regressions):**
- No multi-scene parallel simulation — a split party shares one active scene;
  absent PCs are known-but-not-present (correct), but two simultaneous sub-scenes
  aren't modeled yet.
- Contextual/pronoun target resolution ("the guard", "her") beyond exact
  canonical/alias is deferred — unmatched mentions fall through to normal handling.
- Aliases are explicit (`Character.aliases`); no automatic Thai transliteration and
  no `!rv alias` command yet.
- Spotlight is awareness only (last_actor + counts); no active "spread the
  spotlight" director behavior.

**107 → 124 passing automated tests** (`cd backend && python -m pytest -q`),
including a dedicated multiplayer identity suite.

## Rules evolution (2026-07-09) — what changed
Baseline researched and documented: **SRD 5.2.1, CC-BY-4.0** (docs/rules-sources.md,
docs/rules-coverage-audit.md, docs/next-architecture.md).

- **Rule Definition System**: versioned JSON content (`app/rules_content/srd_5_2_1/`)
  — 6 classes (L1 chassis), 4 species with traits, 4 backgrounds (2024-style: ASI
  trio + Origin feat + 2 skills + tool + equipment), 30 spells with Thai summaries,
  resource definitions. Loaded by a validated read-only registry
  (ruleset_id/definition_id/definition_version).
- **Character v2**: species/background split from backstory; saves, Expertise,
  languages, tool proficiencies, temp HP, speed, Hit Dice, death saves, Exhaustion,
  dying/stable/dead. Grant provenance (`CharacterGrant` — "where did I get this?"),
  spells with kind/prepared state, `ResourceState`, `ActiveEffect`.
- **Derivation engine** (`tabletop/rules/derive.py`): every derived value computed
  with an explainable breakdown — `!rv skill arcana` answers "ทำไมถึง +5" with the
  actual composition. HP/AC/passives/spell DC never AI-assigned.
- **Resource engine + rests**: generic max formulas + recharge semantics (long rest,
  short-rest partial, Arcane-Recovery cycle). Short/Long Rest are domain operations
  on the world clock; a perceivable world event inside the window **interrupts** the
  rest (no benefits, 2024 restart rule).
- **Damage pipeline**: typed components resolved independently (Resistance/
  Vulnerability/Immunity before totaling), temp HP absorbs first (keep-higher),
  dying/death saves/instant death per SRD, healing revives; damage triggers
  **Concentration saves** (DC max(10, dmg/2)); one concentration effect at most.
- **Two-stage creation**: Stage A conversation → reflection card (facts heard, no
  mechanics) → Stage B guided build where the **player chooses everything** —
  class/species/background (⭐ recommended, never auto-applied), Standard Array
  arrangement, background ASI, class skills (legal counts, duplicate handling),
  species trait choices, Rogue Expertise, cantrips/spellbook/prepared — finalized
  in one transaction with full provenance + starting gear.
- **Dice ritual**: campaign `dice_mode` (default PLAYER_CLICK) — visible checks
  pause at a CHECK_PROMPT [🎲 ทอย d20]; the SERVER rolls on tap; ROLL and NARRATION
  arrive as separate messages. AUTO preserves immediate resolution. Hidden checks
  stay silent.
- **Clarification restraint**: engine gate — an adjudicator's clarification is
  honored only when the interpreter also found material missing info ("! แอบฟังต่อไป"
  with an established conversation never asks "ฟังเรื่องอะไร?"). Prompts updated
  with the counter-example; A/B/C choice prompts banned in narration.
- **Failure with teeth**: `Scene.allowed_clues` + `reveal_fragment` delta — the
  model may *time* a partial reveal ("...ไม่ใช่ของมนุษย์") but only from authored
  clue text; inventions are rejected.
- **Views v2**: full sheet (saves ●, Expertise ★, passives, initiative, speed, Hit
  Dice, death saves, spell DC/slots), `!rv spells` (cantrips/spellbook/prepared ✦/
  concentration banner), `!rv skill <name>` breakdown.
- DB additions (additive; delete stale dev sqlite): character v2 columns,
  character_grants, character_spells, resource_states, active_effects,
  scenes.allowed_clues.

**Deferred (designed in docs/next-architecture.md §8):** level-up + subclasses +
executable feats (E2), spell execution engine (E3), combat economy v2 (E4),
campaign Markdown import + DM canon split + blind-owner mode (E5), Grimoire
Activity + DM Studio (E6), Homebrew Lab (E7).

## Experience overhaul (2026-07-09) — what changed
- **Presentation contract**: every player-facing message is kinded
  (`app/presentation`, 21 kinds incl. REVERIE_WELCOME…TECHNICAL_ERROR); the Discord
  adapter renders embeds/colors/buttons (`discord_bot/render.py`); button clicks
  round-trip as typed text (uniform + testable).
- **Guided character creation**: `!rv character` opens a Thai conversation
  (CharacterDraft state machine + CreationGuidance job) → hooks (origin/desire/
  fear/flaw/connection/appearance) stored on Character → CHARACTER_REVEAL with
  class preset + starting gear. Quick path preserved.
- **Session Zero**: `!rv setup` — 4 friendly questions → campaign profile
  (tone/balance/assistance/boundaries).
- **Openings**: Session 1 is AI-generated from a bounded context (profile +
  character hooks + location) and must tie in an established hook; sessions ≥2 get
  recap + place/time continuity. No hardcoded tavern.
- **Readable resolution**: one CHECK_RESOLUTION message = short narration lines +
  visible engine-owned dice line + optional decision prompt. Mechanics never in prose.
- **Error staging**: bridge consults ProcessedMessage.stage — pre-commit failures
  say "nothing happened, retry"; post-commit narration failures restate the
  committed result and never re-execute. No more bare "internal error".
- **Views**: `!rv sheet / inventory / journal / party` (journal derives from
  player-visible events — leak-proof by construction). Items: ItemDefinition/
  InventoryEntry + class starting gear + ITEM_GAINED events.
- **NPC dialogue**: CHARACTER_DIALOGUE at a visible NPC routes to the epistemic
  social service (NPC_DIALOGUE kind, named speaker).
- **Private secrets**: `reveal_secret` consequence delta can only point at a
  PRE-AUTHORED Secret row; delivery is an engine-enforced DM (PRIVATE_SECRET).
- **Closing**: deliberate beat → SESSION_END chronicle (decisions/discoveries/
  items/objectives) → one-tap feedback stored on Session.feedback.
- **Narration policy**: progressive disclosure + banned stock phrases
  (docs/thai-dm-style.md); manual eval fixtures in `backend/evals/`.
- **DB (additive)**: characters.hooks/appearance, character_drafts,
  item_definitions, inventory_entries, sessions.feedback; campaign.config gains
  profile/setup_state keys.

## Key architectural decisions
- **Tests run on SQLite (`aiosqlite`)**; production targets PostgreSQL (`asyncpg`).
  ORM kept dialect-portable (string-UUID PKs, portable JSON). Alembic targets PG.
- **In-process async lock per session** for the serialized action queue (single bot
  process assumed for MVP). Redis deferred until multi-process deployment.
- **LLM never touches state or randomness.** All AI jobs return Pydantic proposals;
  the engine validates + commits. `FakeLLMProvider` drives all tests deterministically.
- Primary keys are `uuid4().hex` strings generated in Python (portable, testable).
- Optimistic concurrency is **manual** (`guarded_version_update` + `version` columns),
  which is explicit and testable.

## §34 first vertical slice — checklist (all covered by test_slice_vertical.py)
- [x] init app / campaign / two members / one character each / location / guard NPC
- [x] start Session 1 / opening scene framed in Thai
- [x] normal message executes NO committed action, mutates NO state, emits NO events
- [x] `!` action: resolve user→character, interpret, decide uncertainty, select Stealth
- [x] server d20 + modifier + DC compare + atomic commit (state+event)
- [x] Thai narration from committed result; scene at rest afterward
- [x] end session; player-safe recap; NO DM-only info in recap

## Definition of Done (§38) — met
- [x] §34 vertical slice passes end-to-end with automated tests
- [x] normal vs `!` routing proven
- [x] LLM provably cannot roll dice, compute modifiers, or mutate canonical state
- [x] information-safety tests pass (recaps + NPC prompts cannot leak)
- [x] concurrency + idempotent recovery tests pass
- [x] opening → active play → closing → post-session with player-safe + private
      continuity artifacts derived from canonical events
- [x] basic social and basic combat function
- [x] docs + PROGRESS reflect the built system

## Supported rules subset (documented in app/tabletop/rules/core.py)
Ability checks, saving throws, single-weapon attacks + damage, flat proficiency bonus
by level, a fixed skill→ability map, a small class/ancestry allowlist. Consequence
deltas limited to a validated allowlist (`advance_time`, `raise_suspicion`, `note`) —
damage/HP only ever come from the deterministic dice/combat path. NOT supported:
spells, subclasses, feats, multiclassing, the full condition set.

## Runnable surfaces
- API: `uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend` (health + read-only admin/debug).
- Bot: `python -m discord_bot.run` (from backend/; needs DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN + a real
  LLM provider). Thin adapter over `app.discord_bridge`.
- Composition root: `app.engine.build_bridge` / `build_default_bridge`.

## Deferred (with reason)
- **Redis distributed lock** — not needed for single-process MVP; in-process lock used.
  Swap in for multi-process deployment.
- **Concrete Alembic migration scripts** — env/wiring is in place (async, targets PG);
  run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial schema"` to generate. Tests use
  `create_all` on SQLite and don't depend on migrations.
- **AI-inferred commitment detection** — intentionally not built; only `!` commits.
  The `ActionCommitment` abstraction + reserved `CommitmentSource` values leave room.
- **`failure_progress_level` config flag** — stored and available; the engine never
  auto-escalates a miss (satisfying "never auto-convert every miss"), but explicit
  band-downgrade enforcement from the flag is left as a tuning hook.
- **Full pipeline↔combat wiring** — the combat engine is complete and tested; routing
  a Thai committed action to an in-progress encounter (target resolution from text) is
  the one remaining integration seam. Social responses likewise have a service
  (`NPCSocialService`) ready to be called from the router.
- **NPC memory / suspicion as separate tables** — consolidated into `NPCFact.status`
  (KnowledgeStatus) + `NPCRelationship`; separate `NPCMemory`/`NPCSuspicion` tables
  are a future normalization, not a capability gap.

## How to run
```
cd backend
python -m pytest -q          # 74 tests
uvicorn app.main:app         # from backend/ (or: uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend)
```
# P0 multiplayer identity audit (2026-07-10)

Verified root cause: `DiscordBridge` correctly resolves the sending campaign member and that
member's active `Character`, and session opening correctly turns attending members' active
characters into `Scene.participants`. The normal committed-action path then loses the group:
`CommittedActionPipeline._process()` hydrates only the acting character; `SceneBrief` ignores
participants and exposes visible entities as raw refs; interpretation target mentions are never
resolved; `_primary_npc_target()` instead selects the first threat/visible NPC; and adjudication,
consequence, and narration receive no explicit typed actor/target/party identities. Thus a second
PC is neither linguistically discoverable nor protected as player-controlled after scene opening.
Attendance, party membership, and scene presence are stored separately, but the read/context
layer did not preserve that distinction. The fix is a bounded, scene-authoritative entity
directory plus deterministic name/alias resolution, threaded as canonical actor and targets
through adjudication, commitment, and narration, with explicit other-PC agency rules.
